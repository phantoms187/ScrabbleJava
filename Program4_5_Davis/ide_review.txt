Program 4/5 IDE Review

					Program 4/5 IDE Review

Program 4 and 5 we shifted are program design away from C++ and into Java.
Java is not written using the same compiler program as C++ and requires a little
more overhead. I decided to use Intellij IDEA to write my Java scrabble game. 

At first using an IDE was rather overwhelming and I had many difficulties just 
getting started. A simple task of creating a new class was not easy or natural 
in this environment. I had a rough start just getting that far. Once I had the 
classes started everything began to fall in line. I enjoyed the on-the-fly error
and warning messages from Intellij. Although annoying they gave me confidence in
my programing without have to compile and run every few methods. I rather 
enjoy the seperate windows for each class and jumping between them is much 
quicker than using vim. Running my program was even easier as I could still see 
my code in a separate window. If I found a mistake I could change it while 
stepping through my program. Although I had a rough start, I think Java and 
using Intellij will be my new favorite language and IDE.
